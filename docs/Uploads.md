## Upload file version

Update a file's content. For file sizes over 50MB we recommend
using the Chunk Upload APIs.

# Request body order

The `attributes` part of the body must come **before** the
`file` part. Requests that do not follow this format when
uploading the file will receive a HTTP `400` error with a
`metadata_after_file_contents` error code.

This operation is performed by calling function `uploadFileVersion`.

See the endpoint docs at
[API Reference](https://developer.box.com/reference/post-files-id-content/).

*Currently we don't have an example for calling `uploadFileVersion` in integration tests*

### Arguments

- fileId `String`
  - The unique identifier that represents a file.  The ID for any file can be determined by visiting a file in the web application and copying the ID from the URL. For example, for the URL `https://*.app.box.com/files/123` the `file_id` is `123`. Example: "12345"
- requestBody `UploadFileVersionRequestBodyArg`
  - Request body of uploadFileVersion method
- queryParams `UploadFileVersionQueryParamsArg`
  - Query parameters of uploadFileVersion method
- headers `UploadFileVersionHeadersArg`
  - Headers of uploadFileVersion method


### Returns

This function returns a value of type `Files`.

Returns the new file object in a list.


## Upload file

## Preflight check before upload

Performs a check to verify that a file will be accepted by Box
before you upload the entire file.

This operation is performed by calling function `preflightFileUpload`.

See the endpoint docs at
[API Reference](https://developer.box.com/reference/options-files-content/).

*Currently we don't have an example for calling `preflightFileUpload` in integration tests*

### Arguments

- headers `PreflightFileUploadHeadersArg`
  - Headers of preflightFileUpload method

can be used to upload the file to.
