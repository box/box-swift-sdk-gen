## Get folder information

Retrieves details for a folder, including the first 100 entries
in the folder.

Passing `sort`, `direction`, `offset`, and `limit`
parameters in query allows you to manage the
list of returned
[folder items](r://folder--full#param-item-collection).

To fetch more items within the folder, use the
[Get items in a folder](#get-folders-id-items) endpoint.

This operation is performed by calling function `getFolderById`.

See the endpoint docs at
[API Reference](https://developer.box.com/reference/get-folders-id/).

*Currently we don't have an example for calling `getFolderById` in integration tests*

### Arguments

- folderId `String`
  - The unique identifier that represent a folder.  The ID for any folder can be determined by visiting this folder in the web application and copying the ID from the URL. For example, for the URL `https://*.app.box.com/folder/123` the `folder_id` is `123`.  The root folder of a Box account is always represented by the ID `0`. Example: "12345"
- queryParams `GetFolderByIdQueryParamsArg`

- headers `GetFolderByIdHeadersArg`
  - Headers of getFolderById method


### Returns

This function returns a value of type `FolderFull`.

Returns a folder, including the first 100 entries in the folder.
If you used query parameters like
`sort`, `direction`, `offset`, or `limit`
the *folder items list* will be affected accordingly.

To fetch more items within the folder, use the
[Get items in a folder](#get-folders-id-items) endpoint.

Not all available fields are returned by default. Use the
